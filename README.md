### LLM-Powered Structured Extraction from Unstructured Clinical Notes (FastAPI + Llama 3.3 70B)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Every day, thousands of clinical documents — discharge summaries, referral letters, and clinical notes — are written in unstructured prose. Extracting key medical information from this text manually is time-consuming and error-prone.

This project builds an AI-powered clinical NLP tool that takes any unstructured medical document and automatically extracts all key structured fields in seconds — plus generates a concise clinical narrative summary.

```
Input:  Unstructured clinical note / discharge summary / referral letter
Output: Structured JSON with 11 medical fields + AI clinical summary
```

The system uses:

• **Llama 3.3 70B** via Groq API — for fast, accurate field extraction  
• **FastAPI** — production-grade Python backend  
• **Prompt Engineering** — carefully crafted clinical extraction prompts  
• **Clinical Summarisation** — auto-generated 3–5 sentence narrative

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary goal is to convert raw clinical prose into structured, machine-readable data.

Extracted fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `patient_age` | Age in years |
| `patient_gender` | Male / Female / Other |
| `admission_reason` | Primary reason for admission |
| `conditions` | List of diagnoses and conditions |
| `medications` | Discharge medications with dosage |
| `blood_pressure` | BP reading from document |
| `key_vitals` | Heart rate, SpO2, temperature, etc. |
| `hospital_stay_days` | Length of inpatient stay |
| `discharge_plan` | Discharge instructions |
| `follow_up` | Follow-up appointments and referrals |
| `document_type` | Auto-detected document type |

## 🔬 NLP Pipeline for Clinical Documents

This project applies large language models to unstructured medical text.

| Aspect | Value |
|---|---|
| Data type | Unstructured clinical text |
| Task | Named entity extraction + summarisation |
| Input | Any clinical document (free text) |
| Output | Structured JSON + clinical narrative |
| Domain | Healthcare AI / Clinical NLP |

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

Two LLM calls are made per document — extraction then summarisation.

---

### Step 1: Structured Field Extraction

Prompt-engineered LLM call that extracts all 11 clinical fields.

Extraction flow:

```
Raw Clinical Document (free text)
↓
Extraction Prompt (prompt engineering)
↓
Llama 3.3 70B via Groq API (temperature=0.1)
↓
Raw JSON Response
↓
JSON Validation + Formatting
↓
Structured Clinical Data (11 fields)
```

Purpose: Convert unstructured prose into machine-readable structured data.

---

### Step 2: Clinical Narrative Summary

Second LLM call that takes the extracted JSON and generates a clinical summary.

Summary flow:

```
Structured JSON (from Step 1)
↓
Summarisation Prompt (clinical language)
↓
Llama 3.3 70B via Groq API (temperature=0.3)
↓
3–5 Sentence Clinical Narrative
```

Purpose: Generate a human-readable summary in professional clinical language.

• **AI Clinical Summary** — auto-generated professional clinical narrative  
• **Collapsible Summary Card** — toggle open/close like an FAQ accordion  
• **Copy Buttons** — one-click copy for summary, individual fields, and full JSON  
• **Export JSON** — download structured data as `.json`  
• **Export CSV** — download structured data as `.csv` for research  
• **Discharge Medication Priority** — discharge meds prioritised over admission meds  
• **Clear All** — reset input and output in one click  
• **Professional UI** — clean, hospital-grade interface

| Medication priority (discharge over admission) | Correctly handled |
| Null field handling | Returns null for missing fields |
| Document type detection | Auto-detected from content |
| Summary quality | Professional clinical language |
